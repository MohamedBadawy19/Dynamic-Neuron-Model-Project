### ðŸ”¹ Initial PINN Training (160 ms)

We first trained the PINN model over a 160 ms window. However, the performance was poor due to its inability to capture rapid voltage spikes.

### ðŸ”¹ Improved PINN Using Spike Detection

To improve the results, we implemented a spike-detection mechanism that allowed the model to better learn the sharp transitions in the neuron signal. This yielded a significantly more accurate outcome.
