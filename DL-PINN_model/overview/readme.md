# 🧠 Dynamic Neuron Model - PINN Visualizer (JavaScript)

This project is a dynamic visualization tool built in **JavaScript** to showcase the results of a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) trained to simulate **neuron spiking dynamics** using the **Izhikevich model**.

Rather than just presenting static numbers, this tool brings the analysis to life with **interactive plots and animated graphs** — offering an intuitive understanding of model performance, errors, neuronal behavior, and biomedical significance.
